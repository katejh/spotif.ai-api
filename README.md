This is the repo for the backend code of spotif.ai. View the frontend code [here](https://github.com/Evanyl/spotifai-front)!


## Technologies

- Django/Django REST Framework
- Tensorflow
- FastAPI
- Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab
- Spotify Web API

## Setup

Clone this repository.

In the root of this repository, create a virtual Python environment with `python3 -m venv venv`.

Activate your virtual environment by running `source venv/bin/activate`.

If you're on windows you'll have to run `source venv/Scripts/activate`.

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Create a `.env` file. See `.env_template` for details on which environment variables you need.

Note: Since loading Tensorflow models is GPU-intensive, we set up an ngrok server in a Google Colab using FastAPI. See the `colab` folder. The URL generated by running this file is what is used for the environment variable `COLAB_SERVER_URL`.

Run `python manage.py migrate`.

## Development

Activate the server with `python manage.py runserver`.
